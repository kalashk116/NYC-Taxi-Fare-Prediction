# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction
The NYC Taxi Fare Prediction project focuses on developing a sophisticated model to estimate taxi fares using historical data from 2017 to 2020. This dataset includes crucial variables such as pickup and drop-off locations, passenger counts, and trip durations. By employing machine learning techniques, particularly regression models, the project aims to uncover patterns that significantly influence fare calculations.To implement this, we utilized Python for model training, Hive for data storage in MySQL, Tableau for data visualization, and PySpark for data cleaning. The project's objective is to deliver reliable fare estimates that enhance user experience and provide actionable insights for decision-making in urban transportation dynamics. By analyzing this data, we aim to offer comprehensive business insights through effective data analysis and visualization techniques.


The dataset is taken from https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ for the taxi rate of 2020
